## Abstract

This paper reports the results of 20 experiments in which mixes of two
or three feldspars were reacted to produce coexisting plagioclase
feldspar (PF) and alkali feldspar (AF). Starting materials with similar
bulk compositions were prepared using different combinations of two and
three minerals, and experiments were designed to produce similar AF and
PF minerals in the experimental products from different starting binary
and ternary compositions. The coexisting AF and PF compositions produced
as products define compositional fields that are elongate parallel to
the ternary solvus. In 11 experiments reaction was sufficient to product
fields of coexisting AF and PF, or AF, PF, and melt with a bulk
composition close to that of the starting mixture. In six experiments
significant reaction occurred in the form of reaction rim overgrowths on
seeds of the starting materials. Three experiments produced AF, PF, and
melt from a natural granite starting material. A two-feldspar
thermometer is presented in which temperature is constrained by
equilibria among all three components - Albite, Orthoclase, and
Anorthite - in coexisting ternary feldspars.
